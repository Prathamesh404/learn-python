## Classes in Python

- Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together.
- Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state.
- Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.
